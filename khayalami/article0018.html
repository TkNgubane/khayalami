                                The FNB Commercial Property Broker Survey for the third quarter of 2021 surveyed a
                                sample of commercial property brokers in and around South Africa's six major metros.

                            <p>

                                “Similar to our buying and selling survey component, the rental market survey component
                                still shows the highest levels of optimism among the industrial and warehouse property
                                market respondents,” says John Loos, Property Sector Strategist at FNB Commercial
                                Property Finance.

                            </p>


                            <h1>In this segment, the activity rating rose from 4.5 in the lockdown second quarter to
                                6.58 in the third quarter of 2021 survey.
                            </h1>


                            <p>
                                "However, during 2021 this sector's activity rating has made little strengthening
                                progress since the 6.51 reading of the first quarter of this year.”
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                The retail sector market activity rating also strengthened - from a 3.62 low in the
                                second quarter of 2020 to 5.31 by the third quarter of 2021. This was the fifth
                                consecutive quarterly increase for this sector.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                The office sector's activity rating rose less significantly - from 3.70 during the hard
                                lockdown second quarter of 2020 to 4.03 for the third quarter of 2021. This leaves the
                                office sector with by far the lowest rating of the three major commercial property
                                sectors.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                Although industrial and retail activity ratings have both improved since the start of
                                the lockdown, only the industrial sector, has recovered to above its pre-lockdown level
                                in the first quarter of 2020.
                            </p>


                            <h2>Vacancy trends</h2>


                            <p>
                                Brokers were asked whether their vacancy rates have risen, remained the same, or
                                declined over the past six months.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                The office property sector was perceived to be by far the weakest major property class,
                                with just over 40% of respondents perceiving vacancies to have been rising in the
                                previous six months, compared to those perceiving a decline.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                “This is still a very strong bias in favour of rising vacancy rates, despite being a
                                significantly lower reading than for the 2020 hard lockdown quarters,” says Loos.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                The retail property sector has an almost neutral bias, and industrial property is the
                                only property class that has shifted to a noticeable declining vacancy rate bias during
                                the third quarter of 2021.
                            </p>


                            <h2>Industrial property</h2>


                            <p>

                                “Although brokers see a relatively strong industrial market, economic fundamentals
                                underpinning that market are questionable,” says Loos.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                “The strength in the industrial property market and perception of declining vacancy
                                rates is interesting, given that the economic sector's key to influencing industrial
                                property performance have not all been returning strong data.
                            </p>

                                For the second quarter of 2021, manufacturing Gross Value Added (GVA) growth was a
                                massive 42.2% year on year.
                            </h1>


                            <p>
                                "However, that growth figure is meaningless as it was due to a very low base from last
                                year's second quarter hard lockdowns. You can better see the manufacturing stagnation of
                                recent years when comparing the second quarter of 2021 real manufacturing GVA to the
                                more normal second quarter of 2019, before COVID-19. This is where it was still a
                                significant -6.3% lower than two years before that,” says Loos.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                “The stagnant manufacturing sector of recent years seems to offer little in the way of
                                strong support for the manufacturing component of industrial property.”

                                He says that manufacturing capacity utilisation was at a low 78.6% in the second quarter
                                of 2021 - down from 83.1% in 2018 and far below the levels of around 87% in the pre-2008
                                economic boom years.

                                Loos says that one positive factor in containing the potential build-up of industrial
                                property oversupply would be a low level of new industrial property building activity.

                                has been a recent increase in industrial space plans passed and completed, which could
                                signal possible future oversupply if economic fundamentals related to industrial
                                property don't improve more meaningfully."

                                may be due to expected interest rate hiking and current economic uncertainty.

                                make sense given its relative affordability in tough economic times, and the fact that
                                it is the most adaptable property class.

                                Brokers surveyed in the third quarter 2021 FNB Property Broker Survey generally
                                perceived strengthening in all three main commercial property sectors' rental market
                                activity levels from the previous quarter.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                Industrial property is the only one to have surpassed the pre-lockdown level of the
                                first quarter of 2020. Industrial property brokers as a group perceive vacancy rates to
                                have declined over the prior six months. This is not yet evident for the retail market,
                                and they still perceive a strong rising vacancy rate trend for the office market.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                When it comes to near-term market activity expectations, the broker group is moderately
                                biased towards strengthening for all three property categories. However, the brokers are
                                generally concerned about the impact of Covid-19 on the economy and the property market.
